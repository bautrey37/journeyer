# Journeyer

An app that tracks your journey's across the world.

View your journey's in multiple ways, through a map, statistics, list, or share it with friends. Filter your journey's to figure out:

- How much time have I spent travelling in X?
- What dates were I in country X going back Y years?
- How many different cities have I visited?
- How many counties have I visited? If I counted stopovers on flight, how does this change?
- How much time have I spent travelling with all my companions grouped by companion?
- Group travelling by year, to compare between years.

## Use Cases

1. A better and improved travel tracking app than the competitors. I find that they lack a lot of detail and customization.

2. When applying for government documents, sometimes they want a full travel history of you going back years. For frequent travellers, this is very burdensome.

3. A easy way to remember and think fondly of past trips. Often times, we forget where we at this particular time.

### Not Supported

- Will not support the granularity of what you did in each city.

## Local Dev

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Deployment

Visit the app at `https://journeyer.fly.dev/`.
